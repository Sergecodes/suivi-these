- added 'message' to EnvoiMessage
- added model Departement
- add operation "changerSujet()" on Dossier
- add field dateSoutenance on Etudiant
- add method envoyerDossier with updated params in Etudiant
- rename field 'rapportUrl' in Avis to rapport
- extract connecter and deconnecter methods then import them using stereotypes & what not

todo:
    - send notification(and eventually email) to admin when user's account is created
    - implement validator for matricule 
    - 


* matricule and etudiant should not be unique, this will permit a student to register
maybe eventually i.e to have a master2 and doctorat account in the system
* etudiant login: email ou matricule, password, niveau
